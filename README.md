# FIFA 21 Player Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a comprehensive analysis of the FIFA 21 player dataset using linear regression and support vector machines (SVM). The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed information about players' attributes and statistics.

## Repository Contents
- `fifa-lin-logs-svm.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the "fifa-21-complete-player-dataset" from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset).

## Analysis Overview
The notebook performs the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and performing initial data exploration.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and data preprocessing.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
5. **Model Training**: Training linear regression and SVM models.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and suggesting future work.
